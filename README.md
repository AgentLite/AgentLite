# agent_lite
Lightweight, generic typings and utils for building custom agents in your app's backend.

## Installation
The simplest way is to install the package through a regular pip install.
```
pip install agent-lite
```

Alternatively, you can build the project from source.

## Use Cases
- Building custom agents that you have fine-grained control over
- Using this library as a complementary extension to LlamaIndex and Langchain integrations

Like React, you can use as little or as much of this library as you'd like. Personally, I think simple structure for composable agents is sorely needed in the Generative AI space (as of early 2024).

## Basic Functionality
- Tools for LLMs to use
- Simple typings for chains of agent steps
- Serializable chains of arbitrary functions
